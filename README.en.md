## Terms from the Docker universe

### Docker

Docker is software that allows applications to run in containers. These containers are lightweight and contain everything they need to run. They can run on any operating system that has Docker installed.

#### Docker Image

A Docker image is a template that Docker uses to create containers. An image contains everything that is a[Container](#docker-container)needed to run. An image can consist of one or more layers. Each layer contains a set of instructions that are executed when a container is created. If an image contains multiple layers, the last layer is used as a base and the previous layers are added as an overlay.

#### Docker Container

A container is an executable instance of a[Docker Images](#docker-image). A container is an isolated environment made up of a series of layers. Each layer contains a set of instructions that are executed when a container is created. If a container contains multiple layers, the last layer is used as a base and the previous layers are added as an overlay.

#### Dockerfile

A Dockerfile is a file that contains instructions that Docker uses to create a[Docker Image](#docker-image)to create. A Dockerfile contains a set of instructions that are executed when an image is created. If a Dockerfile contains multiple statements, the last statement is used as the base and the previous statements are added as an overlay.

##### Example Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y cowsay
CMD ["cowsay", "Hello World"]
```

### Docker Compose

Docker Compose is a tool that allows you to create application environments with multiple[Docker containers](#docker-container)based on definitions set in a YAML file. It uses service definitions to build fully customizable, multi-container environments[Networks](#docker-netzwerke)and[data volumes](#docker-volumes)can share.

#### Example Docker Compose

```yaml
version: '3.7'

services:
  web:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - "8000:80"
    volumes:
      - .:/code
    depends_on:
      - redis
  redis:
    image: "redis:alpine"
```

### Docker Networks

Docker networks are a way to connect containers together. Docker offers three different types of networking:`bridge`,`host`and`none`.`bridge`is the default mode in which Docker connects containers together.`host`uses the host network of the host where the container is running.`none`disables the network for the container.

#### Example Docker Compose with network

```yaml
version: '3.1'

services:
  web:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - "8000:80"
    volumes:
      - .:/code
    depends_on:
      - redis
  redis:
    image: "redis:alpine"
    networks:
      - backend

networks:
    backend:
```

### Docker Volumes

Docker Volumes are a way to share data between containers. Docker offers two different types of volumes:`bind`and`volume`.`bind`binds a directory on the host to a directory in the container.`volume`creates a volume managed by Docker.

#### Example Docker Compose with Volume

```yaml
version: '3.1'

services:
  web:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - "8000:80"
    volumes:
      - .:/code
    depends_on:
      - redis
  redis:
    image: "redis:alpine"
    volumes:
      - redis-data:/data

volumes:
    redis-data:
```

## Workshop

### Preparation

Check the following things to prepare:

-   [ ] Docker installed and running`docker version`
-   [ ] Docker Compose installed and running`docker compose version`
-   [ ] You are with[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)logged in`docker login`
-   [ ] **Optional:**For this repo, press the star ‚≠ê in the top right corner :D
-   [ ] Fork this repository on GitHub and clone it to your computer

### Tasks

**The goal of the tasks**is it a[Docker Image](#docker-image)to create one that runs a simple web application. The web application should output a simple HTML page. We will then start the docker image locally and look at how we can access the application via the browser.

1.  Creating a Dockerfile
2.  Starting a container
3.  Logging des Containers mit`docker logs`
4.  Opening a website in the browser
5.  Debugging des Containers mit`docker exec`
6.  Restart the container
7.  Stop the Containers
8.  Using Volume Mounts
9.  Publish your own image in the registry
10. Creating a Docker Compose file
11. Starting, stopping and debugging an application with Docker Compose
12. **Bonus:**Setting up a GitHub Action that automatically builds the image and pushes it into the registry

### Task 1 - Creating a Dockerfile

First let's look at a simple Docker image. To do this we create a directory and create a file called`Dockerfile`with the following content:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y cowsay
CMD ["cowsay", "Hello World"]
```

### Task 2 - Starting a container

Now we can start building the image. To do this, we change to the directory and execute the following command:

```bash
docker build -t workshop .
```

The`-t`Flag gives the image a name. The dot at the end of the command indicates that the Dockerfile is in the current directory.

Now we can start the container:

```bash
docker run workshop
```

### Task 3 - Logging the container with`docker logs`

We can view the container's log with the command`docker logs`display. To do this we need the container ID, which we use with the command`docker ps`can be displayed.

```bash
docker logs <container-id>
```

### Task 4 - Opening a website in the browser

For a website we need a web server. To do this we create a new file called`Dockerfile`with the following content:

```dockerfile
FROM nginx:latest
COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
```

So that we can access the website in the browser, we create a new file called`index.html`with the following content:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Workshop</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Workshop</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

Now we can build the image and start the container:

```bash
docker build -t workshop .
docker run -p -d 8000:80 workshop
```

The`-p`Flag binds port 80 of the container to port 8000 of the host. The`-d`Flag starts the container in the background.

### Task 5 - Debugging the container with`docker exec`

We can view the contents of the container with the command`docker exec`display. To do this we need the container ID, which we use with the command`docker ps`can be displayed.

```bash
docker exec -it <container-id> bash
```

### Task 6 - Restart the container

We can open the container with the command`docker restart`start anew. To do this we need the container ID, which we use with the command`docker ps`can be displayed.

```bash
docker restart <container-id>
```

### Task 7 - Stopping the container

We can open the container with the command`docker stop`stop. To do this we need the container ID, which we use with the command`docker ps`can be displayed.

```bash
docker stop <container-id>
```

### Task 8 - Using Volume Mounts

We can open the container with the command`docker run`with the`-v`Start flag. To do this we need the path to the directory on the host and the path in the container.

```bash
docker run -v $PWD:/var/www/html workshop
```

Die Variable`$PWD`specifies the path to the current directory.
The path in the container is after the colon.

### Task 9 - Publish your own image in the registry

We can create our own image using the command`docker push`upload to the registry. To do this we need the name of the image and the tag.

```bash
docker push <image-name>:<tag>
```

The day is optional. If not specified, will`latest`used.

### Task 10 - Creating a Docker Compose File

We can have multiple containers with the command`docker run`start. To do this we need the names of the images and the ports.

```bash
docker run -p 8000:80 workshop
docker run -p 8001:80 workshop
```

We can also create a Docker Compose File. To do this we create a new file called`docker-compose.yml`with the following content:

```yaml
version: '3.7'
services:
  workshop:
    image: workshop
    ports:
      - 8000:80
  workshop2:
    image: workshop
    ports:
      - 8001:80
```

You can find further material on the topic[here](Material/Task-Task-10/task-10.md).

### Task 11 - Launching an application using Docker Compose

We can use the application with the command`docker-compose up`the start.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

The`-d`Flag starts the application in the background like Docker.

**Here is a list of the most important commands:**

```bash
docker-compose up -d # Startet die Anwendung im Hintergrund
docker-compose down # Stoppt die Anwendung
docker-compose ps # Zeigt die laufenden Container an
docker-compose logs # Zeigt die Logs der Container an
docker-compose exec <service> bash # Startet eine Shell im Container
```

### Task 12 - Setting up a GitHub Action

We can create a GitHub Action that will be triggered on every push on the`main`Branch uploads a new image to the registry. To do this we create a new file called`.github/workflows/docker.yml`with the following content:

```yaml
name: Docker
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
    build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        - name: Build and push
            uses: docker/build-push-action@v2
            with:
            push: true
            tags: workshop
```

The GitHub Action is updated with every push on the`main`Branch executed. It builds the image and uploads it to the registry.

You can find out more about GitHub Actions[here](Material/Task-Task-Bonus/task-bonus.md).
